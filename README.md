# Sentiment_analysesFromTweeter

Welcome to this repository, where you will find information on sentiment analysis and text mining developed for a series of interviews conducted for a water treatment plant in Canada.

Here you will find a codebook called interview1F, which includes examples of how the analyses were developed using the programming language R. Additionally, you can access one of the reports developed for the month of February and copies of the interview transcripts.

Moving forward, I will continue to work on the codebooks and develop new interventions on the transcripts to further practice my skills in textual data analysis using NLTK in Python.

For now, I hope you enjoy the material and find it useful. Thank you for visiting this repository!
