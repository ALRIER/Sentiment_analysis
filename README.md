# Sentiment_analysesFromTweeter

In the following repository, you will find a book called Interview1F, which contains a sentiment analysis and text mining derived from an interview conducted with people who discuss issues with their digestion.

Additionally, there is a codebook with the same structure, but it also works with an R package to download information from Twitter. 

Cheers, hope you like the code and find it useful. 

:)
